/**https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/min_cost_flow.html
 * Given a network  $G$  consisting of  $n$  vertices and  $m$  edges. 
 * For each edge (generally speaking, oriented edges, but see below), 
 * the capacity (a non-negative integer) and the cost per unit of flow 
 * along this edge (some integer) are given. Also the source  $s$  and 
 * the sink  $t$  are marked.
 * For a given value  $K$ , we have to find a flow of this quantity, 
 * and among all flows of this quantity we have to choose the flow with 
 * the lowest cost. This task is called minimum-cost flow problem.
 * Sometimes the task is given a little differently: you want to find 
 * the maximum flow, and among all maximal flows we want to find the 
 * one with the least cost. This is called the minimum-cost maximum-flow 
 * problem.
 * Both these problems can be solved effectively with the algorithm of 
 * successive shortest paths.
